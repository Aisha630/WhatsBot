Hello, experiencing pain during menstruation is a common occurrence for many women.
If this pain is manageable and doesn't significantly affect your daily activities such as attending school, work, or other tasks, and if you're able to carry on with these activities despite menstrual pain, then there might not be a necessity to visit a doctor
Suggests pain management strategies, including over-the-counter tablets, maintaining bone strength through diet, and when to seek medical help based on the intensity of pain
The level of pain during menstruation depends on several factors. What is your age? Are you married or not, and do you have children? Is the size of the uterus normal, and are there any abnormalities present? Is there any fluid inside or outside the uterus? These conditions contribute to the extent of pain experienced during menstruation. However, they are not directly related to consuming hot or cold foods
If you're experiencing chronic body pain and seeking treatment, there are natural pain-relieving properties found in certain foods and remedies. Hot milk, tea, kahwa, dates, dried fruits, almonds, and a protein-rich diet like eggs are natural food items known to alleviate pain
